The research question this proposal addresses is:
- Is it possible to create a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system that can extract the components of a SPO’s Impact Model, including stakeholders, programs, services, outcomes and indicators, from unstructured text, in an explainable, tractable, governable, and verifiable way?

Our research objectives are to:
1.  Develop an architecture that can extract Impact Model components from unstructured 
texts where the components are not explicitly stated but must be inferred from the text. 
2.  Extend existing social services ontologies ([Fox et al., 2021a](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3073/paper26.pdf); [Fox et al., 2021b](https://commonapproach.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Common-Impact-Data-Standard-V1.1.pdf); 
[Gajderowicz et al., 2022b](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3249/paper2-OSS.pdf); [Rosu et al., 2022](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3249/paper1-OSS.pdf); [Fox et al., 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9922132)), implemented as a 
knowledge graph, and are capable of storing learned information about Impact Models 
and responding to queries about learned knowledge. 
3.  Develop metrics for measuring the architecture’s correctness, tractability, explainability, 
and governance. 

We propose a hybrid-AI architecture that improves upon existing machine learning models trained on large corpora of unstructured text. It is an opportunistic architecture based on the Blackboard architecture ([Hayes-Roth et al., 1978](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780934613033500295)) that combines multiple sources of knowledge (methods) to extract the components of an SPO’s impact model embedded in unstructured text.
- Each knowledge source represents a competing or complementary method for extracting impact model components.
- Some knowledge sources post components extracted as hypotheses on the Blackboard with associated levels of certainty as to their validity.
- Some knowledge sources evaluate, select and/or combine hypotheses generated by other knowledge sources.
- There will be multiple types of Knowledge Sources for: 
  - Large Language Models such as ChaptGPT;
  - linguistic rules and statistical patterns used to extract relevant information; 
  - filling gaps in data, reasoning about counterfactuals;
  - reasoning about temporal, geospatial, and structural concepts;
  - creating, validating, and reasoning about extended narratives about key terms and events;
  - allowing for multi-hop reasoning about narratives.
- A controller will opportunistically manage the selection and invocation of knowledge sources based on their potential contribution to extracting, confirming or refuting impact model components.
