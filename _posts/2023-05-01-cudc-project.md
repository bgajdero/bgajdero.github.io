The mission of the [Canadian Urban Data Catalogue](https://data.urbandatacentre.ca/) (CUDC) is to provide awareness of the vast array of urban and non-urban Canadian data by providing an open catalogue of Canadian datasets. It catalogues both open and closed datasets, along with data accessible via web services. CUDC is openly available for searching and creating new catalogue entries. CUDC uses a rich metadata model that supports the documentation and search for datasets relevant to a userâ€™s needs. Catalogue entry metadata may be exported from and imported to CUDC in bulk or entered manually.
