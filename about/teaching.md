# Instructor

#### MIE 451 (1513) – Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department
University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario1 semester: 2015
MIE 451 Decision Support Systems.This course is co-taught as the graduate course MIE 1513. During the Fall 2015 semester, my responsibilities include designing the syllabus, creating and modifying slides for the entire course, managing one teaching assistant, creating exams, designing projects, mentoring students, and grading assigned course work. The course covers various techniques for information analysis, knowledge-based problem solving methods such as heuristic search, automated deduction, constraint satisfaction, and knowledge representation. Prolog is used as the main implementation language. Graduate students have a choice of a final project in Prolog or a combination of a Prolog and a research report.

#### CXCP 685 – Information Technology Studies
Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario3 semesters: 2010 to 2011
CXCP 685 PHP/MySQL Web Design Fundamentals. Responsibilities included creating, administer, and grading lectures notes, assignments, tests, and a final exam. The PHP language is used to introduce programming constructs and web application principles. MySQL is used to introduce database access basics. The course teaches students how to develop dynamic and secure web applications with a database back-end.

#### CPS 125 – Computer Science Department
Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario2 semesters: 2009 to 2010
CPS 125 Digital Computation and Programming. Responsible for over 75 engineering students. The C programming language is used to introduce students to computer architecture, as well as programming principles and best practices. Topics include computer architecture, C syntax, programming constructs, file I/O, strings, arrays, and multidimensional matrices.

# Teaching Assistant
#### MIE 457 – Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department
University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario1 semester: 2017
MIE 457 Knowledge Modelling and Management. My responsibilities included creating and presenting tutorial every week on the topics covered. I was also one of two TAs responsible for administering laboratory lessons, assisting students with technologies used, and answering questions. This course explores both the modelling of knowledge and its management within and among organizations. Knowledge modelling focuses on knowledge types and their semantic representation. It reviews emerging representations for knowledge on the World Wide Web (e.g. RDF and OWL). Emerging knowledge modelling and automated reasoning software was used in the laboratory.

#### MIE 1512 – Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department
University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario 1 semester: 2016
MIE1512 Data Analytics. My responsibilities included creating and marking all non-lecture material, including assignments and laboratories. I was responsible for learning multiple data analytics technologies, including Python and Scala Notebooks, IBM Bluemix, and experimental systems including IBM Data Scientist Workbench. The course required me to evaluate each package, its strengths and weaknesses and provide students with instructions on using these technologies for their laboratory assignments and projects. This course is a research seminar that focuses on recent developments in the area of Data Analytics and Big Data. This seminar provides an overview of data analytics concepts, approaches, and techniques, including distributed computations on massive datasets and frameworks for enabling large-scale parallel data processing on clusters of commodity servers. Emphasis is given to algorithmic techniques for analyzing Web Data. The project goal is to prepare publishable research contributions in the area of data analytics.

#### MIE 253 – Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department
University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario 1 semester: 2016
MIE253 Data modelling. As the head TA, I was responsible for managing seven TAs, organizing laboratory and assignment grading schedules. I was also responsible for giving lectures, as well as creating and marking assignments. This course provides an understanding of the principles and techniques of information modelling and data management, covering both relational theory and SQL database systems (DBMS), as well as entity-relation conceptual modelling. The course also familiarizes the student with analytical applications (OLAP) and provides an introduction to XML data management. The laboratory focuses on database application development using SQL DBMS, OLAP queries and data modelling.

#### MIE 451 – Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department
University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario1 semester: 2014
