# Welcome
I am a computer scientist and a researcher at the Industrial Engineering Department at the University of Toronto, with a focus on computational sociology. I use **ontologies** and **data-driven artificial intelligence** (AI) methods to study how people and groups interact in complex systems. My current focus is on cities, communities, and urban centres.

<!-- 
My research focuses on three key areas of Computational Sociology. 
1. creating data-driven decision support systems with a holistic view of social behaviour;
1. creating data integration and holistic view impact measurement model through semantic technologies and ETL; and
1. creating human-centric simulation and evaluation models that consider various facets of human behaviour. -->

See a list of my [research projects &#8675;](#research-section) and [publications &#8675;](#publications-section).

I use AI to help organizations make smarter data-driven decisions. In my research group we create **ontologies** that allow for **semantic interoperability** between data silos. We create **ETL pipelines** that consolidate data in a **knowledge graph**, and perform **data analysis** on the graph. We are developing an **explainable language model** to extract information and build a knowledge graph for custom domains.

Recently, our team has developed a [catalogue of urban datasets](/cudc-project) to help researchers find and integrate datasets from across Canada. This work resulted in a **Maturity Model** for urban dataset metadata.

We have an ongoing partnership with the [Common Approach](/common-approach-project) where we continue to evolve the Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS) for measuring impact of social purpose organizations across Canada. 

I'm currently working on new tools for **government agencies to measure impact**, study how **health information and opinions spreads online**, and improve **search capabilities in distributed systems**.
