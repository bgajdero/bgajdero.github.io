# Welcome
I'm a computer scientist at the Industrial Engineering Department at the University of Toronto. I use **ontologies** and **data-driven artificial intelligence** (AI) methods to study how people and groups interact in complex systems, including cities and communities.

See a list of my [projects](#projects-section) and [publications](#publications-section) below.

I use AI to help cities make smart decisions based on data, relying on semantic technologies for data integration and decision support systems. 

In my research groups we create **ontologies** that allow for **semantic interoperability** between data silos. We create **ETL pipelines** and consolidate data in a **knowledge graph**, and perform **data analysis**. An **explainable language model** allows us to extract information and build a knowledge graph for custom domains.

Recently, our team has developed a [catalogue of urban datasets](/cudc-project) to help researchers find and integrate datasets from across Canada. This work resulted in a **Maturity Model** for urban dataset metadata.

We have an ongoing partnership with the [Common Approach](/common-approach-project) where we continue to evolve the Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS) for measuring impact of social purpose organizations across Canada. 

I'm currently working on new tools for **government agencies** to **measure impact**, study how **health information** and opinions spreads online, and improve **search capabilities** across systems.
