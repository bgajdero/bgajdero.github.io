I'm a computer scientist at the University of Toronto. I study how people and groups interact in complex systems, with a focus on communities and urban spaces. I use artificial intelligence (AI) to help cities make smart decisions based on data. 

See a list of my [projects](#projects-section) and [publications](#publications-section) below.

I create computer models that help us understand and improve our cities and communities. This work results in data standards that promote interoperability and tools that help analyze how different parts of a city or a community interact and work together. My focus is on making data easy to use and understand, and tracking the activities that make impactful changes in our communities.

This work focuses on making sure data from different places can work together easily. This helps organizations team up and share resources to tackle big challenges. 

Recently, our team has developed a [catalogue of urban datasets](/cudc-project) to help researchers find and integrate datasets from across Canada. This work resulted in a Maturity Model for urban dataset metadata.

We have an ongoing partnership with the [Common Approach](/common-approach-project) where we continue to evolve the Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS) for measuring impact of social purpose organizations across Canada. 


I'm currently working on new tools for government agencies to measure their impact, study how health info spreads online, and improve search systems.
